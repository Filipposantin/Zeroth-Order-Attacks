# Zeroth Order Attacks

Optimization for Data Science 

This project was created in the context of an university assigment. We were asked to study and compare different algorithm in order to perform adversarial attack on a neural network. The folder consegna ods contains the Matlab implementation of the project:

preliminaries file to execute in order to have the right set up
Algo2 implementation of stochastic FW based attack
Det_FW implementation of deterministic zeroth order FW
FW_black implementation of FW based attack
ORD implementation of ORD
experiments_* attacking 100 istances in order to obtain performances of the algo *
distorsion_* computation of mean distortion of the algo *
