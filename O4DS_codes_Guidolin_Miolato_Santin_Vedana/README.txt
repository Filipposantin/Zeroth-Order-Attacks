This project was created in the context of a university assignment. 
We were asked to study and compare different algorithm in order to perform adversarial attack on a neural network.

- preliminaries 	file to execute in order to have the right set up
- Algo2 		implementation of stochastic FW based attack
- Det_FW		implementation of deterministic zeroth order FW
- FW_black		implementation of FW based attack
- ORD			implementation of ORD
- experiments_*		attacking 100 instances in order to obtain performances of the algo *
- distortions_*		computation of mean distortion of the algo *
